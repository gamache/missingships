  Drawing from far reaching musical inspiration including soul, interstellar groove, druggy drone, arena pop explosions, psychedelic freak outs and rock noir Missing Ships are a dynamic and unique part of Brooklyn’s flourishing music scene.

  Music from Missing Ships’ EP Girls All Night, Vol. 1 was recently featured on the first episode of the tattoo culture show Marcus Kuhn’s The Gypsy Gentleman.

  With the dynamic vocal talents of Mimi, Meryl, and Greggy and the catchy, soulful, rock accompaniments of Nick, Zack,  Matt, and Ben the band was selected to perform on Live Band with Jamie Lamm filmed at The Knitting Factory.
